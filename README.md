# Bioinformatics and Machine Learning

Building a bioinformatics project for drug discovery using Python and machine learning. This projects was possible thanks to a freeCodeCamp tutorial developed by Chanin Nantasenamat at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlTQjcKuaY. 

The 'Acetylcholinesterase' folder contains several jupyter notebook files along with the corresponding .csv and .txt files for building a ML model. This is an example based on work done for this particular target protein, acetycholinesterase.
